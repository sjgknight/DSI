You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: #install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) library(bookdown) options(bookdown.render.file_scope = FALSE) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. 1.1 Whats in here? There are: Some vignettes (next), two sample AT2 templates, there is also a third but embedding it currently breaks things. And then references. There are learnr packages Ill include at some point. 1.2 To download and use the code And code for the book can be found https://github.com/sjgknight/dsi #If you&#39;ve downloaded the code for the book, you can preview it by running the line below #bookdown:::serve_book() "],["preamble.html", "2 Preamble", " 2 Preamble The aim of this file is to show you some basic functionality of an Rmd, and some of the kinds of analysis you might do.

"],["some-introductory-functions.html", "3 Some introductory functions 3.1 First, were going to load libraries", " 3 Some introductory functions This is an export of an R Markdown Notebook. When you access the raw notebook, you can execute code within the notebook on your computer and the results appear beneath the code. If you have downloaded the code, you can try executing this chunk by clicking the Run button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter. 3.1 First, were going to load libraries Normally youd hide the code chunk below, but in this instance well keep it there. library(tidyverse) #loads ggplot2, stringr, #Installing tidyverse includes (but won&#39;t load as part of it) readxl, jsonlite, lubridate, httr, rvest, xml2, googlesheets4, library(readxl) library(jsonlite) library(lubridate) library(httr) #these are also useful (in part to demonstrate features) library(psych) library(doBy) library(reshape2) library(lattice) library(scales) library(tidytext) #SimComp lets me create some random datasets with defined properties library(SimComp) #The ones below are specifically for this data library(dslabs) library(trackeR) library(trackeRapp) #library(maptools) #library(revgeo) #So I can embed webpages #install.packages(&quot;webshot&quot;) #webshot::install_phantomjs() library(webshot) library(htmlwidgets) library(widgetframe) Add a new chunk by clicking the Insert Chunk button on the toolbar or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+I. When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the Preview button or press Ctrl+Shift+K to preview the HTML file). The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike Knit, Preview does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

You might find some of them useful. You can also explore the examples https://quantifiedself.com/show-and-tell/ and various other sources! Remember, there is no expectation that you code in DSI 36100. There are many many freely available tools that will help you run the kind of basic exploratory statistical analyses you need for AT2 (e.g.Â spreadsheet tools), and visualise data. There are also free tools that will analyse text and images (although possibly not in batch, unless you use an app to collect the images), again without coding. The key thing for this assignment is thinking creatively about how to analyse and make sense of the data and the justification for that, not demonstrating advanced coding skills. Most of the examples below are from MDSI students (a couple from me, and a few externals). 4.1 Useful other tools or snippets of code You might also find these few posts useful: An Introduction to Accessing RESTful APIs Using R, by Werner Schott, March 31, 2019: In the past, working in R has meant importing data into the application from numerous sources. I have found this very manual and not very reproducible in the development of applications. One of the weaknesses I have identified and would like to address is to understand how to access online data resources using the appropriate packages in R. The scope of this exercise is not to master the use of one package or several packages, but rather understand how certain R packages fit into the overall process, and what that process is. http://rpubs.com/plantagenet/481658 Use R-Studio on any PC (with portable apps), Joshua McCarthy, 29 March 2019, Someone out there has kindly adapted R to the Portable Apps framework! This means we can use R and R-Studio anywhere we like without needing to install R and R-Studio locally, quite handy for work, University computers and VMs. We can also keep all our libraries and packages in one location making them easier to manage when moving between workstations. http://rpubs.com/jsmccid/rportable https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate - this is very cool, create animated gif visualisations http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html - nice examples of a bunch of ggplot charts Create sonified data (using audio to represent the shape of data, as we use visualisation) http://playitbyr.org/ https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleway/vignettes/googleway-vignette.html - connect to a variety of google map based services Want to visualise your web history? Heres one way to do that https://www.webhistorian.org/education/ Some time ago I saw a blog post on visualising your twitter history using streamgraphs in R. As my tweets moved from mostly psychology/philosophy tweeting around my teaching, through to my current mish-mash of learning analytics stuff, I thought itd be interesting to play with this. So, heres the code reproduced, plus my streamgraph. http://sjgknight.com/finding-knowledge/2016/01/visualising-twitter-history/ Remember, not all of these approaches are good or sensible approaches, consider how you use standard features like tables and reporting numbers, and dont go overboard with complex visualisations. 4.2 gganimate if(!file.exists(&quot;vignettes/gganimate.html&quot;)){ file.copy(RShowDoc(&quot;gganimate&quot;, package = &quot;gganimate&quot;), &quot;vignettes/&quot;, overwrite = FALSE) #file.copy(vignette(&quot;gganimate&quot;), &quot;vignettes/&quot;, overwrite = FALSE) } knitr::include_url(&quot;vignettes/gganimate.html&quot;) 4.3 Garmin #uses the library trackeR.

"],["introduction-to-the-at2-templates.html", "5 Introduction to the AT2 Templates", " 5 Introduction to the AT2 Templates For your AT2 assignment we ask you to submit your report as a knitted file. You do not have to write any r code to do this. At simplest, you can create all your analysis (data, visualisations) in other programs, and use rstudio and markdown to embed these, and format your document. RStudio has made this a lot simpler recently because there is now an inbuilt visual editor (Im using it right now and it looks almost exactly like a Word document!). Even if you use this view, you should still get familiar with the basics of markdownfor example, these little chunks with a grey background are introduced by using the \\` key (top left on my keyboard) before and after the code example. To make something bold, we use \\* before and after the words, and so on. Weve created a template to help with this. You can download this as a Project file, either at the guthub repository https://github.com/sjgknight/DSI-templates or via drive https://tinyurl.com/DSIAT2Template (they should be in sync).

The code for this book is available at https://github.com/sjgknight/dsi/ You can download a set of interactive tutorials from https://github.com/sjgknight/learnr most of these were built by the great RStudio team and collaborators. There are three ways you can get the code: The easiest: Go to that repository, on the right hand side youll see code - click that, and download zip (or, direct link) Medium level: You can do the same thing using R. Now youve got R installed, you can run the code below to do this. Git-method: If youre using git anyway (or, going to learn in Stats, Data Science Practice, or another subject) you might like to link the project to the repo, there are instructions for that at Happy Git and GitHub for the useR. download.file(url = &quot;https://github.com/sjgknight/learnr/archive/refs/heads/master.zip&quot;, destfile = &quot;dsi-learnr.zip&quot;) #if you want the book too, you can uncomment this line # unzip the .zip file unzip(zipfile = &quot;dsi-learnr.zip&quot;) 6.2.2 Creating and opening projects RStudio helps you manage projects. Make sure the download is unzipped in a location you want it on your machine: If youve downloaded an existing project, you might find the .Rproj file, and click that Now youre inside a project. Projects help you organise your work. They are associated with directories and their subdirectories. You can create new ones under the File menu.
