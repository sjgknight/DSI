[["index.html", "R Notebook 1 Prerequisites", " R Notebook Simon Knight 2021-07-25 1 Prerequisites This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/.

When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Try executing this chunk by clicking the Run button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter. 2.1 First, were going to load libraries Normally youd hide the code chunk below, but in this instance well keep it there. library(tidyverse) #loads ggplot2, stringr, #Installing tidyverse includes (but won&#39;t load as part of it) readxl, jsonlite, lubridate, httr, rvest, xml2, googlesheets4, library(readxl) library(jsonlite) library(lubridate) library(httr) #these are also useful (in part to demonstrate features) library(psych) library(doBy) library(reshape2) library(lattice) library(scales) library(tidytext) #SimComp lets me create some random datasets with defined properties library(SimComp) #The ones below are specifically for this data library(dslabs) library(trackeR) library(trackeRapp) #library(maptools) #library(revgeo) Add a new chunk by clicking the Insert Chunk button on the toolbar or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+I. When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the Preview button or press Ctrl+Shift+K to preview the HTML file). The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike Knit, Preview does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed. 2.2 Garmin #uses the library trackeR.
