## Notes

The structure of the this project is as follows:

* ~ contains various bookdown files and below directories
** Key file is '_bookdown.yml' which defines the Rmd files that make up the book
* Private - (see first page of bookdown)
* Materials - contains various bits of subject content
** Number of .Rmd files, included in _bookdown.yml
** Data directory, which contains sample data 
** Some vignettes for convenience (there should be a way to include these without saving them, but I can't see how quickly enough)
* I have moved Templates to a separate repository
* I will be adding learnr activities
