# Snippet matchR 
This page just embeds the Shiny app hosted at  https://sjgknight.shinyapps.io/Snippet_matchR/
The files for this are included in the github respository, and so you may prefer to run it locally. If doing so, set eval/include as true in the second of these code blocks.
```{r embed}
knitr::include_ap(" https://sjgknight.shinyapps.io/Snippet_matchR/",
                  height = "600px")

```

```{r embed_local, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#something here
# shinyAppDir(
#   system.file("examples/06_tabsets", package="shiny"),
#   options = list(width = "100%", height = 700)
# )
```
