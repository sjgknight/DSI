# The ODI Canvas
Don't forget to include the data ethics canvas
You can download it and include it like this (play around with the settings to make it display sensibly). You can also include it as a html file, etc.

```{r add_ODI_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
#knitr::include_graphics("../DSI_copy_ODI_Data_Ethics_Canvas.pdf")

#knitr::include_url("https://docs.google.com/document/d/14qEn_yoOpInUAvA8ndNGMNuhxgywQJ3ODmCKcxYZPGQ/edit?usp=sharing")
```
```
